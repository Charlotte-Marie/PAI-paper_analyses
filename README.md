This repository belongs to the manuscript **"Advancing the Personalized Advantage Index (PAI): a Systematic Review and Application in Two Large Multi-Site Samples in Anxiety Disorders"**. 
It contains files that have been used for the various steps of the analyses performed in the paper, 
including:
- data preparation for machine learning
- the machine learning pipeline of the biased traditional approach
- documents and scripts to reproduce the systematic review

Please note that the main script implementing the advanced low bias approach for calculating the PAI is presented in another repository to enhance comprehension: https://github.com/Charlotte-Marie/PAI_Advanced_Approach.
